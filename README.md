This project intends to develop an integrated platform in Android and Windows to track and categorize expenses.

For this project, we are going to try and use Google Sheets with its Python API.

For now, the application is implemented only for windows.
Do not install the application on the "Programs File" folder.
In order to use it, after installing the released version, or downloading the source code, you must enable the Google Sheets API following the instructions in the topic "Step 1: Turn on the Google Sheets API" in https://developers.google.com/sheets/api/quickstart/python. After enabling it, click on "DOWNLOAD CLIENT CONFIGURATION" to download a credential.json file, copy it and paste in the application installation folder or in src/main/python.

After doing so, you must enable the Google Drive API following the instructions in https://developers.google.com/drive/api/v3/enable-drive-api.
